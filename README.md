# ReversiAI
Using a traditional method (min max with alpha beta pruning), I implemented Reversi algorithm to compete a local greedy algorithm.

# Instruction
Using three tabs on terminal,
(Black) run reversi_server, run greedy_player and run minmax_player (my code).
(White) run reversi_server, run minmax_player (my code), and run greedy_player.


# To-Do to improve
[ ] Make a board smaller at first and expend everytime (Expandable)
[ ] Make a board more weight around cornors (Currently, only weights on four cornors)
[ ] Quiescence search
